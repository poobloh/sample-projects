# sample-projects
Code from previous classes and personal projects

### ASM Project
Language: x86 Assembly (.s)

### Data Structure Projects
Language: C++

### Digital Systems Projects
Language: C

### Embedded Systems Final Project
Language: C
* Using [STM32F4 Discovery Board microcontroller board], final project consisted of demonstrating all embedded systems knowledge
* Board must _**simultaneously**_:
  * read input from keyboard through Breakout module and change LED blink rate on STM board
  * read input from hex keypad (16 buttons, pseudo-piano capable of different scales) and convert to music
![alt text](http://www.circuitstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hex-keypad-arduino.png "Hex-Keypad Sample")  
  * read input from pseudo-theremin (photocell resistor whose values raise or lower according to light on it). As hand moves closer or farther away from theremin, sound output is higher or lower dB
  * output music notes to terminal through Sparkfun FT232R Breakout module
  * output music to speaker system
  * output sound from pseudo-theremin module

##### Finished Project (speaker not shown):

Language: Java
* various self-made programs that replicate the ArrayList and List classes

### Magic Square
Language: C 

### Probability Project
Language: MATLAB

### Prog3
Language: Java
* Programs that utilize java.io File functions
* Prog3a: 2 command line inputs (inputFilename and word), opens file to search for word
* Prog3b: 2 command line inputs (inputFilename and outputFilename), reads csv file and writes a new file with spaces replacing commas
* Prog3c: 1 command line input (inputFilename), reads double values from file and prints as longitude/latitude pairs

### RPi Project
Language: C

### Tic Tac Toe A.I.
Language: C++
* Command-line driven game with ASCII graphics 
* Tic Tac Toe with capability of playing against another player or the computer
* Computer AI is unbeatable and utilizes the minmax algorithm explained [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Combinatorial_game_theory).

### Weather Watcher
Language: Java
* [realtimeweb WeatherService](https://github.com/RealTimeWeb/weather/tree/master/java/src/realtimeweb), tests methods with cached .json file and prints/analyzes data in table format
* .json file cached and pulled from

Code from previous classes and personal projects

### Embedded Systems Final Project
Language: C
* Using [STM32F4 Discovery Board microcontroller board], final project consisted of demonstrating all embedded systems knowledge
* Board must _**simultaneously**_:
  * output keyboard inputs to terminal through USB on another computer
  * output music to speaker system
  * output sound from pseudo-theremin module
  * take input from hex keypad (16 buttons, pseudo-piano capable of different scales) and convert to music

  * take input from pseudo-theremin (photoresistor whose values raise or lower according to light on it). As hand moves closer or farther away from theremin, sound output is higher or lower dB
  * 

### Lab 6
Language: Java
* various programs that replicate the ArrayList and List classes

### Prog3
Language: Java
* Programs that utilize java.io File functions
* Prog3a: 2 command line inputs (inputFilename and word), opens file to search for word
* Prog3b: 2 command line inputs (inputFilename and outputFilename), reads csv file and writes a new file with spaces replacing commas
* Prog3c: 1 command line input (inputFilename), reads double values from file and prints as longitude/latitude pairs

### Weather Watcher
Language: Java
* [realtimeweb WeatherService](https://github.com/RealTimeWeb/weather/tree/master/java/src/realtimeweb), tests methods with cached .json file and prints/analyzes data in table format
* .json file cached and pulled from 

### Tic Tac Toe A.I.
Language: C++
* Command-line driven game with ASCII graphics 
* Tic Tac Toe with capability of playing against another player or the computer
* Computer AI is unbeatable and utilizes the minmax algorithm explained [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Combinatorial_game_theory).
